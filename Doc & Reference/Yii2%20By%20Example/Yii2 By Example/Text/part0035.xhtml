We also created examples where we used custom rules to parse and create the URL. Finally, we learned how to build more customized URL rules through Rule classes.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will cover the use of a database, which is a fundamental aspect of every web application. We will start from the configuration of a database connection through to the tools that Yii2 makes available to developers, and to build a complete reservation system based on database data, using framework widgets.</p></div></body></html>
