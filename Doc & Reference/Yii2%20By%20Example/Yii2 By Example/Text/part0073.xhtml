So, if we have a remote hosting without this capability, it could be difficult for us to install and use Yii with the advanced template.</p><p>If we cannot add the console capability to remote hosting, we have two possibilities:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Create the project in the local environment where we can install what we want and need; it is enough to locally install a WAMP or a LAMP distribution (based on the operating system of the hosting machine) and then launch the composer command to install Yii</li><li class="listitem">Launch the <code class="literal">init</code> command to initialize the project (it could be initialized from start in production mode so that no other changes are needed)</li></ul></div><p>Therefore, the project is ready to be uploaded to remote hosting. Remember that project environment is in production mode, but in this way, we do not have to change the configuration manually<a id="id438" class="indexterm"></a> if we want to pass from development <a id="id439" class="indexterm"></a>to production mode.</p></div></body></html>
