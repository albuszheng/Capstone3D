We have seen static and dynamic views, we have learned how to render views in layout and pass data from Controller to View and then we have looked at reusing Views through partial views and blocks. </p><p>Finally, we have manipulated layouts, changing them conditionally.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will display URLs in a pretty format, which is very important for all <span class="strong"><strong>search engine optimization</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SEO</strong></span>) activities on the website.
