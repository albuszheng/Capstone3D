Then, we have applied a console application with a concrete example, such as making maintenance operation to the reservation table in order to update the status of the reservations to expired.</p><p>Then, we focused on how the console application can make pretty outputs, using colors and text formatting features.</p><p>Finally, we have mastered how to create a complete periodic task with a console controller action to send a daily summary e-mail containing reservations made in current date.</p><p>In the final chapter, we will see the final stage of our development, where we have to make the code reusable but, especially, maintainable.</p></div></body></html>
