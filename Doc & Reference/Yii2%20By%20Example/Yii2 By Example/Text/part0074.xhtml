We have found out differences between basic and advanced templates, installing our first advanced project based on advanced templates.</p><p>Then we have used the <code class="literal">init</code> command to customize development or production environment in which to make the application run. Then we have written an example to display in the frontend rooms list, similar to what we have done in the previous basic template.</p><p>Finally, we customized URLs to make them pretty also in the advanced template, to refer to frontend and backend without URL application prefix. We also learned how to use advanced templates in shared hosting that does not have access to the console.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will explain how to write a multilingual app, adapt, and render the app in different languages without changes to the source code.</p></div></body></html>
