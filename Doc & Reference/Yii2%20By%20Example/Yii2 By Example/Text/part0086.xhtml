We adopted the approach of creating a new application in order to distribute RESTful web services, instead of mixing web and <code class="literal">api</code> controllers. For this purpose, at the beginning of the chapter, we configured a new REST application using the advanced template.</p><p>After configuring the RESTful web service environment, we discovered two kinds of <code class="literal">api</code> controllers that Yii provides by default, then we created controllers with custom data and data from ActiveRecord.</p><p>Next, we found out the default authentication methods for RESTful Web Services provided by framework and you learned how to use them.</p><p>Finally, we focused on how to customize the response output format, taking an example of how to create an RSS version of the available data.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to write a console application and will look at the differences between web and console apps.</p></div></body></html>
